    "## What is TEMPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "TEMPO is a Python package for detecting trajectory motifs — recurring temporal\n",
    "patterns — that are enriched in one group of subjects relative to another in\n",
    "longitudinal biological data. The core algorithm, **Harbinger analysis**, uses\n",
    "the STUMPY matrix profile to find windows of time where one group shares a\n",
    "conserved pattern that the other does not. This is analogous to gene-set\n",
    "enrichment analysis (GSEA) but operating on time-series trajectories rather\n",
    "than ranked gene lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The core use case: perturbation-response studies\n",
    "\n",
    "TEMPO is designed for studies where subjects receive a perturbation —\n",
    "a drug, a vaccine, a transplant, a dietary intervention, an environmental\n",
    "exposure — and you want to know which measured features show a trajectory\n",
    "that distinguishes responders from non-responders. The question is not just\n",
    "\"which features differ between groups at a single timepoint?\" but \"which\n",
    "features follow a distinctive *shape* over time in one group that the other\n",
    "lacks?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This framing covers a wide range of data types: immune cell population\n",
    "dynamics from flow cytometry, cytokine time courses, metabolite profiles,\n",
    "clinical lab values, or any high-dimensional longitudinal measurement where\n",
    "the relative composition of features is tracked over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this vignette covers\n",
    "\n",
    "We walk through a complete Harbinger analysis on a bundled example dataset:\n",
    "40 subjects (15 responders, 25 non-responders) measured over 12 timepoints\n",
    "across 15 features. Three features carry a planted trajectory motif in the\n",
    "responder group between timepoints 3 and 8, representing a coordinated feature\n",
    "response to a perturbation. Our goal is to recover those features and that\n",
    "window from the data alone, without knowing the ground truth in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is: **load → explore → preprocess (CLR) → Harbinger → visualise →\n",

    "## 2  Exploring the Raw Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running any algorithms it is worth looking at the raw trajectories. This\n",

    "The dataset uses **compositional measurements** — at every (subject, timepoint)\n",
    "the 15 feature values sum to 1.0, representing proportions of a whole. This\n",
    "format arises naturally whenever you measure the relative breakdown of a system:\n",
    "cell type fractions from a flow cytometry panel, relative metabolite abundances,\n",
    "or proportional scores across clinical categories. The compositional constraint\n",
    "means features are not independent — if one proportion increases, others must\n",
    "collectively decrease to compensate, which has important consequences for\n",
    "preprocessing (see section 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "We show two views. First, individual trajectories for the three signal-carrying\n",
    "features and three noise features, with the known motif window shaded in gold.\n",
    "The responder/non-responder separation in raw proportion space is often subtle\n",
    "because renormalisation to sum-to-1 partially absorbs any shift. Second, group\n",

    "\n",
    "Harbinger analysis is the core of TEMPO. It uses STUMPY's `mstump` function —\n",

    "subjects simultaneously show the most conserved shared pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the matrix profile works:** for a given window size *m*, the matrix\n",
    "profile records, at each position in the time series, the distance to the\n",

    "motif positions (repeated patterns); high values indicate discords (unique\n",

    "i.e., where the cross-subject matrix profile is minimised.\n",
