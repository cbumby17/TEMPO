    "Before running any algorithms it is worth looking at the raw trajectories. This\n",

    "data, where we observe proportions rather than absolute counts. The compositional\n",

    "We show two views. First, individual trajectories for three motif features and\n",
    "three noise features side by side, with the known motif window shaded in gold.\n",

    "simplex renormalisation absorbs some of the boost. Second, group mean ± SD\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running Harbinger we apply the **Centred Log-Ratio (CLR)** transform.\n",
    "This step is important for two reasons that are specific to compositional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the simplex constraint creates spurious correlations. Because all features\n",
    "sum to 1, an increase in any one feature mathematically forces the others down —\n",
    "even if there is no biological relationship. The Euclidean distances that the\n",
    "matrix profile computes are misleading in this constrained space. CLR maps the\n",
    "data from the probability simplex to unconstrained real space where Euclidean\n",
    "geometry is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, CLR uses the geometric mean of the whole composition as a reference,\n",
    "rather than any single taxon. This means the transform is equivariant to\n",
    "permutations of features and does not privilege any particular taxon as the\n",
    "denominator — a desirable property compared to earlier log-ratio methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a composition **x** = (x₁, …, xₚ) at one sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "> CLR(xᵢ) = log(xᵢ) − mean(log(x₁), …, log(xₚ))\n",
    "\n",
    "After CLR, values can be negative, are no longer bounded to [0, 1], and sum to\n",
    "zero within each sample (a useful sanity check). A small pseudo-count (default\n",

    "## 4  Harbinger Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Harbinger analysis is the core of TEMPO. It uses STUMPY's `mstump` function —\n",
    "a multidimensional pan-matrix profile — to find the time window where case\n",
    "subjects simultaneously show the most conserved shared pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the matrix profile works:** for a given window size *m*, the matrix\n",
    "profile records, at each position in the time series, the distance to the\n",
    "nearest matching subsequence elsewhere in the series. Low values indicate\n",
    "motif positions; high values indicate discords. `mstump` extends this to a\n",
    "stack of time series (one per case subject), finding the position where all\n",
    "case subjects agree on a shared pattern — i.e., where the cross-subject\n",
    "matrix profile is minimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-window scanning:** we pass `window_size_range=(3, 6)` to scan all\n",
    "window lengths from 3 to 6 timepoints. For each feature, Harbinger picks the\n",
    "(size, position) combination with the highest enrichment score — letting the\n",
    "data vote on the best window rather than requiring us to pre-specify it. This\n",
    "makes the method more robust when the true window width is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enrichment score:** at the winning window, the enrichment score is\n",
